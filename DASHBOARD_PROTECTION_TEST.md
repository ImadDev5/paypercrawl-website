# Dashboard Access Protection Test

## Problem
User can access `/dashboard` without an invite token, bypassing the middleware protection.

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Middleware configured in `middleware.ts`
- ✅ Client-side validation in dashboard page
- ✅ Layout protection added
- ✅ Enhanced logging for debugging

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Clear Browser Data
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Clear all cookies for localhost
4. Clear localStorage and sessionStorage
5. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Step 2: Test Middleware
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` directly
2. Check browser console for middleware logs
3. Should see redirection to `/waitlist`

### Step 3: Test with Valid Token
1. Get a valid invite token from admin dashboard
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/dashboard?token=VALID_TOKEN`
3. Should grant access and set cookie

### Step 4: Test Cookie Persistence
1. After successful access, remove token from URL
2. Refresh page
3. Should maintain access via cookie

## Debug Information
Check browser console for these logs:
- "Middleware executing for: /dashboard"
- "Dashboard route detected, checking tokens..."
- "Tokens found: {...}"
- "No token found, redirecting to waitlist" OR "Token found, allowing access"

## If Middleware Not Working
If middleware logs don't appear, try:
1. Restart development server (`npm run dev`)
2. Check Next.js version compatibility
3. Verify middleware.ts is in project root
4. Check for conflicting routes or configurations

## Alternative Protection
If middleware continues to fail, the following backup protections are in place:
- Dashboard layout protection
- Component-level token validation
- Server-side checks

## Production Note
Middleware works more reliably in production builds. Test with:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
