## 🗄️ Database Integration

### Analytics Data Source
Data is pulled from the existing `wp_crawlguard_logs` table with these fields:
- `timestamp` - When the bot was detected
- `bot_type` - Type of AI bot (GPT, Claude, etc.)
- `revenue_generated` - Revenue from that request
- `ip_address` - Bot's IP address
- `bot_detected` - Whether it was identified as a bot

### Data Retention
- Automatically keeps **only 90 days** of data
- Daily cron job cleans up old logs at 2 AM
- Optimized queries with proper indexing

## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** - UI framework
- **Recharts** - Chart library
- **React DOM** - Rendering

### Backend
- **PHP Class**: `CrawlGuard_Analytics`
- **AJAX Endpoints**: 
  - `crawlguard_get_analytics` - Main analytics data
  - `crawlguard_get_realtime_stats` - Dashboard stats
- **Database**: MySQL via WordPress $wpdb

### Build System
- **Webpack 5** - Bundler
- **Babel** - JavaScript compiler
- **Mini CSS Extract** - CSS extraction

## 📦 Files Added/Modified

### New Files Created:
```
assets/js/src/
├── index.jsx                       # React app entry point
└── components/
    └── AnalyticsDashboard.jsx      # Main analytics component

assets/css/
└── analytics.css                    # Analytics styling

includes/
└── class-analytics.php              # Analytics data handler

assets/js/
└── analytics.bundle.js              # Compiled React bundle (484 KB)
```

### Modified Files:
```
crawlguard-wp.php                    # Added analytics loading & cron
includes/class-admin.php             # Added React analytics integration
webpack.config.js                    # Added analytics build config
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Data Collection**
When a bot is detected by `class-bot-detector.php`, it logs the detection to `wp_crawlguard_logs` with:
- Bot type
- Revenue generated
- Timestamp
- IP address

### 2. **Data Aggregation**
`CrawlGuard_Analytics::get_analytics_data($days)` processes logs:
- Groups by date for time-series
- Aggregates by bot type
- Calculates hourly patterns
- Computes summary statistics

### 3. **Data Delivery**
WordPress AJAX endpoint (`ajax_get_analytics`) delivers data as JSON:
```php
{
  "revenueData": [...],
  "botTypeData": [...],
  "hourlyData": [...],
  "statsOverview": {...}
}
```

### 4. **Visualization**
React component renders Recharts with the data:
- Fetches on mount
- Updates when period changes
- Shows loading states
- Handles errors gracefully

## 🎨 User Experience

### Dashboard View
1. User opens **CrawlGuard → Dashboard** in WordPress admin
2. If plugin is activated (API key valid), they see:
   - Stats overview cards at the top
   - Period selector (7/30/90 days)
   - 6 interactive charts
3. Charts are interactive:
   - Hover for exact values
   - Smooth animations
   - Responsive layout

### Performance
- Charts render smoothly even with 90 days of data
- AJAX requests are cached in WordPress transients
- Database queries use proper indexes
- Bundle size: 484 KB (includes entire Recharts library)

## 🔒 Security

- **Nonce verification** on all AJAX requests
- **Capability checks** (`manage_options`)
- **SQL injection prevention** via `$wpdb->prepare()`
- **XSS protection** via proper escaping
- **API key validation** required for analytics

## 📱 Responsive Design

Charts adapt to screen size:
- Desktop: Full grid layout
- Tablet: Stacked charts
- Mobile: Single column, optimized sizing

## 🎯 API Key Requirement

Analytics only work when:
1. ✅ Valid PayPerCrawl API key configured
2. ✅ Plugin is activated
3. ✅ Bot detections are being logged

If no API key, users see: "Activate the plugin to see analytics"

## 🧹 Data Cleanup

### Automatic Cleanup
- Runs daily at 2:00 AM
- Deletes logs older than 90 days
- Keeps database size manageable
- Scheduled via WordPress cron

### Manual Cleanup
```php
CrawlGuard_Analytics::cleanup_old_logs();
```

## 🔌 No External Dependencies

Everything is **self-contained** in the plugin:
- No calls to external APIs for charts
- All data stays in WordPress database
- Works offline/intranet
- GDPR compliant (user's own database)

## 📈 Example Analytics Queries

### Revenue Over Time
```sql
SELECT DATE(timestamp) as date,
       COUNT(*) as detections,
       SUM(revenue_generated) as revenue
FROM wp_crawlguard_logs
WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-10-03'
AND bot_detected = 1
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
```

### Bot Type Distribution
```sql
SELECT bot_type as name,
       COUNT(*) as count,
       SUM(revenue_generated) as revenue
FROM wp_crawlguard_logs
WHERE bot_detected = 1
GROUP BY bot_type
ORDER BY count DESC
```

### Hourly Activity
```sql
SELECT HOUR(timestamp) as hour,
       COUNT(*) as count
FROM wp_crawlguard_logs
WHERE bot_detected = 1
GROUP BY HOUR(timestamp)
```

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Colors
Edit `assets/css/analytics.css`:
```css
.stat-value {
    color: #0073aa; /* Change primary color */
}
```

### Chart Types
Recharts supports many chart types. To add more, edit `AnalyticsDashboard.jsx`:
- ScatterChart
- RadarChart
- ComposedChart
- TreeMap
- And more...

### Data Refresh Rate
Currently fetches on:
- Page load
- Period change

To add auto-refresh, add to `AnalyticsDashboard.jsx`:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(fetchAnalytics, 30000); // 30 seconds
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Charts Not Showing?
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify `analytics.bundle.js` exists in `assets/js/`
3. Ensure API key is valid
4. Check that bot detections are being logged

### No Data in Charts?
1. Confirm bots are actually visiting your site
2. Check database: `SELECT * FROM wp_crawlguard_logs LIMIT 10;`
3. Verify monetization is enabled
4. Ensure bot detection is working

### Slow Performance?
1. Check database indexes on `wp_crawlguard_logs`
2. Reduce retention period from 90 to 30 days
3. Enable WordPress object caching
4. Optimize MySQL queries

## 📚 For Developers

### Adding New Chart Types
1. Edit `assets/js/src/components/AnalyticsDashboard.jsx`
2. Import chart type from Recharts
3. Add chart markup
4. Update data processing in `class-analytics.php`

### Custom Metrics
1. Add metric to `get_analytics_data()` in `class-analytics.php`
2. Return in response data
3. Access in React via `data.yourMetric`
4. Render in JSX

### Build Command
```bash
cd /workspaces/paypercrawl-website-public/crawlguard-wp-main
npm run build
```
