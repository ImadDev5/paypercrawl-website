**Process:**
```
User clicks download button
    ↓
API reads from: crawlguard-wp-main/
    ↓
Creates ZIP dynamically with archiver
    ↓
Filename: crawlguard-wp-paypercrawl.zip
    ↓
Cache: 5 minutes (then rebuilds)
    ↓
User downloads updated plugin
```

**Cache Status:** 
- ✅ Cache cleared (server restarted at deployment time)
- ✅ Next download will include all latest changes
- ⏱️ Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Download the Plugin

**Frontend URL:**
```
https://yourdomain.com/dashboard#download
```

Or direct API call:
```bash
curl -o plugin.zip https://yourdomain.com/api/plugin/download
```

### 2. Verify ZIP Contents

After downloading:
```bash
# Extract and check
unzip -l crawlguard-wp-paypercrawl.zip

# Should see:
# - crawlguard-wp/includes/class-bot-detector.php
# - crawlguard-wp/includes/class-rate-limiter.php
# - crawlguard-wp/FIRECRAWL_PROTECTION_UPGRADE.md
```

### 3. Check File Size

```bash
# Check the bot detector file inside ZIP
unzip -p crawlguard-wp-paypercrawl.zip crawlguard-wp/includes/class-bot-detector.php | wc -l

# Should show: 479 lines
```

### 4. Search for Firecrawl Code

```bash
# Extract and verify Firecrawl detection is present
unzip -p crawlguard-wp-paypercrawl.zip crawlguard-wp/includes/class-bot-detector.php | grep -i "firecrawl"

# Should show entries like:
# 'firecrawl' => array('company' => 'Firecrawl'...
# 'HTTP_X_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY'
```

## Install & Test on WordPress

### Installation Steps:

1. **Download** plugin from your dashboard
2. **Upload** to WordPress:
   - WP Admin → Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin
   - Choose the ZIP file
   - Click "Install Now"
3. **Activate** the plugin
4. **Configure** settings:
   - Go to CrawlGuard → Settings
   - Enable "Rate Limiting" under Feature Flags
   - Set rate limits:
     - Per IP per minute: `10`
     - Per IP per hour: `100`
   - Enter your API key from PayPerCrawl dashboard

### Test Firecrawl Detection:

**Method 1: Curl Test**
```bash
# Test with Firecrawl user-agent
curl -H "User-Agent: Firecrawl/1.0" https://your-wordpress-site.com/

# Should see: 402 Payment Required or block message
```

**Method 2: Header Test**
```bash
# Test with scraper API header
curl -H "X-Firecrawl-API-Key: test123" https://your-wordpress-site.com/

# Should be detected and blocked
```

**Method 3: Rate Limit Test**
```bash
# Spam requests to trigger rate limiter
for i in {1..15}; do 
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Request $i: %{http_code}\n" https://your-wordpress-site.com/
done

# Should see: 200 responses, then 429 after ~10 requests
```

### Check WordPress Logs:

```sql
-- Check detection logs in WordPress database
SELECT 
  ip_address,
  user_agent,
  bot_type,
  bot_detected,
  action_taken,
  timestamp
FROM wp_crawlguard_logs
WHERE bot_detected = 1
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## What Gets Blocked Now

### ✅ Detected & Blocked:
- Firecrawl (with User-Agent or API header)
- ScrapingBee, ScraperAPI, Bright Data
- Oxylabs, Smartproxy, Zyte, Apify
- Requests from AWS/Google Cloud/Azure IPs
- Requests without proper browser headers
- Rate limit violators (>10 req/min)

### ⚠️ Might Still Get Through:
- Firecrawl with perfect browser mimicry + residential proxy
- Very slow scrapers (under rate limit threshold)
- Scrapers that perfectly emulate human behavior

### ✅ Not Blocked (Normal Users):
- Real browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Mobile apps
- Legitimate search engine bots (if in allowed list)
- API clients with proper authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ZIP file is old, doesn't have updates"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear cache manually by restarting server
# Or wait 5 minutes for auto-refresh
```

### Issue: "Can't download from frontend"

**Check:**
1. Is server running? Check http://localhost:3000/api/plugin/download
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try direct API URL in browser

### Issue: "Plugin installed but not detecting Firecrawl"

**Check:**
1. Is rate limiting enabled in Feature Flags?
2. Is monetization enabled?
3. Check WordPress error logs
4. Verify database tables exist:
   - `wp_crawlguard_logs`
   - `wp_crawlguard_rate_limits`

## File Versions

**Original Files (Before Update):**
- `class-bot-detector.php`: 368 lines, ~36 known bots
- `class-rate-limiter.php`: Soft limiting only

**Updated Files (After Update):**
- `class-bot-detector.php`: **479 lines**, ~46 known bots
- `class-rate-limiter.php`: **Hard blocking with HTTP 429**

## Important Notes

1. **ZIP filename stays the same**: `crawlguard-wp-paypercrawl.zip`
   - No version numbering in filename
   - Updates are transparent to users

2. **Old ZIPs in repo** (can be ignored):
   - `paypercrawl-wp-v2.0.0.zip` - Old backup
   - `paypercrawl-wp-v2.0.1.zip` - Old backup
   - `crawlguard-wp.zip` - Old backup
   
   These are NOT served by the download API.

3. **Dynamic generation means**:
   - Every download reflects latest code
   - No manual ZIP building needed
   - Changes go live after cache expires (5 min) or server restart

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Download plugin from your frontend
2. ✅ Install on WordPress test site
3. ✅ Enable rate limiting + monetization
4. ✅ Test with curl commands above
5. ✅ Monitor `wp_crawlguard_logs` table
6. ✅ Check for Firecrawl detections
